# g_scatter
A ggplot2-inspired scatter plot for Python/pandas/matplotlib.

Scatter plots are one of the most intuitive and popular data visualizations. While most use scatter plots to plot two features (on the x and y axes), one or two additional features can be displayed by utilizing marker size and marker color options. While displaying marker size and marker color is not difficult with matplotlib, communicating the meaning of marker size and marker color directly on the plot through a figure legend is not as simple as when using ggplot2 in R. This script shows one way to do this. While this function is not tied to the efforts at Yhat, you can also check out their more comprehensive Python ggplot package [here](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/).
